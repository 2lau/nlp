# Customer Review Analysis
A restaurant owner is looking at Yelp review for the restaurant.<br>
The owner is interested in extracting useful insights from these Yelp reviews.<br>
However, the amount of customers feedback is too large and too complex to process manually.<br>
We can utilise NLP to process and analyze these large amounts of Yelp reviews.<br><br>
